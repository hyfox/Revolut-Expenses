# Revolut → E‑conomic Connector

A small Python project that helps connect **Revolut Business** with the Danish accounting system **E‑conomic** (by Visma).
Maintained as a **hobby project by Albert Fox** (CEO of Performativ) and used internally at Performativ for more than a year.

The goal is to make reconciled bookkeeping with Revolut Business **fast, reproducible, and less painful**.
With this tool, we bring a full month of reconciled transactions into E‑conomic in about **1 hour total**.

## ✨ Features

* **Imports expenses from Revolut Business CSV exports**
* **Processes receipts/attachments** and maps them to E‑conomic entries
* **Interactive GUI** for stepping through bookkeeping tasks
* **Secure credential storage** via OS keychain (Windows Credential Manager or macOS Keychain)
* **Pushes data to E‑conomic REST API** with vouchers, VAT, contra accounts, and attachments
* **File renaming & cleanup** so your receipts match journal entries neatly

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The project is split into two files:

* **`Main.py`**
  Provides a simple Tkinter GUI with buttons for each step:
  *Save credentials → Gather data → Load settings → Verify data → Ship to E‑conomic → Split files*

* **`Economic.py`**
  Handles the heavy lifting: reading CSVs, mapping accounts, preparing vouchers, calling E‑conomic APIs, and managing local file storage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Libraries:

  * `requests`
  * `tkinter` (usually comes with Python)
  * `keyring`
  * `pillow`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install requests keyring pillow
```

### Setup

1. **Clone or download** this repository.

2. Run `Main.py` to launch the GUI:

   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```

3. First step: **Save credentials**.
   You’ll be asked for your E‑conomic API AppSecretToken and Agreement Grant Token. These are stored securely in your OS keychain.

4. Export your **expenses.csv** from Revolut Business and place receipts in the same folder.

5. Click through the steps in the GUI to:

   * Load your settings JSON
   * Process expenses
   * Select the journal in E‑conomic
   * Ship entries + attachments

## 🔐 Security Notes

* **No hardcoded tokens**: You must save your own tokens to your OS keychain.
* The `.exe` builds created with PyInstaller still contain your logic but not your secrets. Tokens remain safe in your OS credential store.

## 📂 Project Status

* This is **not an official Performativ product**.
* It’s a **hobby project**, built to scratch our own itch, and open‑sourced in case others find it useful.
* Used successfully for 12+ months at Performativ.

* Support for additional banks besides Revolut
